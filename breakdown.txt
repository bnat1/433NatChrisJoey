Here is what each file does.


index.php:
	-does nothing, goes straight into login.php

index.css:
	-styling

login.php:
	-gets user input, validates with regex
	-if the information is valid, goes into courses.php

mysqlHelper.php:
	-functions to be called by other pages
	-functions:
		-make a query
		-add a user
		-get user info/classes
		-function update each class type (ex. updateSci updates the users science courses)

courses.php:
	-checkbox page for all courses
	-user can select courses and submit
	-upon being checked, courses are added to an array 'taken[]'

index_js.js:
	-dealing with course pre-reqs, keeping boxes uncheckable
	-used for the courses.php page

authenticate.php:
	-simply makes sure the user accesses login.php first

landing.php:
	-goes through array taken[] and uses regex to sort into categories (sci, cmsc200, etc)
	-lists courses the user can take
